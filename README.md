1) "user_soliton.F90"
My undergraduate thesis work about the interaction of laser pulse with plasma to create an ultrashort pulse for the study of biological structures.
I did PIC simulations with Fortran code called TRISTAN-MP. 
I did not change the code, but I've written an additional package for my particular problem. 

2) "PlanetDiskPy"
A project on protoplanetary disks for a course called "computational mathematics". 
In particular, the project was about the interaction of the disk material with the planet and subsequent evolution of this planet. 
For the computational part of this project, I analyzed data from numerical simulations of these disks.  
As the simulations were three-dimensional and required a lot of outputs, 
I worked with tens of terabytes of data, and the routine which I wrote had to be fast and efficient. 
I used a couple of external packages, files that I wrote are "__main__.py" and "DiskPlanet.py".
